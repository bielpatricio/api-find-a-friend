# About The Project

Find a Friend Api.
In this challenge I developed an API for animal adoption, a FindAFriend API, using SOLID and tests.

## RFs (Functional requirements)

- It must be possible to register a pet
- It should be possible to list all pets available for adoption in a city
- It should be possible to filter pets by their characteristics
- It must be possible to view details of a pet for adoption
- It must be possible to register as an ORG
- Must be able to login as an ORG

## RNs (Business rules)

- To list the pets, we must inform the city
- An ORG needs to have an address and a WhatsApp number
- A pet must be linked to an ORG
- The user who wants to adopt will contact the ORG via WhatsApp
- All filters other than city are optional
- For an ORG to access the application as admin, it needs to be logged in

## RNFs (Non-functional requirements)

- The user's password must be encrypted;
- Application data must be persisted in a PostgreSQL database;
- All data lists must be paginated with 20 items per page;
- The user must be identified by a JWT (JSON Web Token);
